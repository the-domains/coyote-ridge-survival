# OUR FRIENDS

Here you will find the websites of people that we have come to know in the industry, and are proud to call our friends.

**Thistledown Forge** - [www.thistledownforge.com][0] - Maker of hand crafted metal and leather goods, located in Lynchburg, VA. Jonathan is the metal genius that hand crafted the Tyr knives over a coal fired forge, while Felicia is the magician that coaxed the leather in to a sheath for it. Jonathan and Felicia take pride in only using the best materials, no reclaimed steel is used. Yes, they accept custom orders!

**Minuteman Provision Company** - [www.minutemanstove.com][1] is a manufacturer of rocket stoves, survival stoves, camping cookware and other materials located in Reidsville, North Carolina. You have to see the video to believe these stoves! Check it out [here][2].

**Advanced Survival Training** - [www.advancedsurvivaltraining.com][3] School founder and instructor Tim MacWelch has been professionally teaching a wide variety of survival skills to the public since 1997\. He is also the author of multiple New York Times Best Selling books on survival. Since the time before there were survival TV shows and before there were preppers, MacWelch has been teaching the best of survival skills to all who were willing to learn. Tim is not only a fount of knowledge, but also manages to be one of the most down to earth people that I have had the privilege to know.
